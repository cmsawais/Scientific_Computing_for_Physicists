    "Ans: While perfroming this task on my laptop, i cencountered runtime error for highehr N value but this time I executed the task on GPU cluster with 2TB memory and 3GPU. In my implementation I also used memory-light verification (checksums/samples for the vector case, and an analytic check for the matrix case), so even without huge memory the tests would still be feasible.

    "Ans: Yes, I was able to test the sume and product correctly. For vectors, i verified each element is equal to 7.4 for different N values. I computed checksum and printyed head/tail samples and I also used isclose tolerance for binary rounding of 0.1. With constant matrices, the final result must be 21.3N. For robustness and analytic expectatation, i sampled the enteries of C and compared to 21.3N with a small toleracne. These suggestions were taken from GPT5. All test passed.  "
